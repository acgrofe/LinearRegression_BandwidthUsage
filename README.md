This assignment was for my coursework in D208: Predictive Modeling at Western Governors University. We were provided with a data set that housed customer information for a telecommunications company. In this course we focused on predictive modeling where I used several packages (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, sklearn) to build out a reduced model to help predict a customer's expected bandwidth usage over the course of a year.

The project was very time consuming and some of my code is "not pretty" as I was hoping to satsify the requirements of the assignment. There are much cleaner ways to have built this out, but it was my first go at building linear regression models.

In the attached file you will see some of my thinking and commentary as I progressed through the assignment.
